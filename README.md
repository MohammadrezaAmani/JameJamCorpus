# Jam-e Jam News Corpus

Welcome to the official repository for the Jam-e Jam News Dataset and NLP Model. This repository contains a comprehensive dataset of news articles scraped from the [Jam-e Jam Online](https://jamejamonline.ir) website. The dataset includes information such as title, tags, types, timestamp, summary, and content for over 1.4 million news articles.

In addition to the dataset, we have developed a powerful NLP model for classifying news articles based on their types and tags. This model can be used for tasks such as text classification.

## Dataset Formats

The dataset is available in various formats to cater to different needs:

- SQLite: [Link to SQLite dump file](./datasets/sqlite/dataset.sqlite)
- PostgreSQL: [Link to PostgreSQL dump file](./datasets/psql/dataset.dump)
- CSV: [Link to CSV file](./datasets/csv/dataset.csv)
- TSV: [Link to TSV file](./datasets/tsv/dataset.tsv)
- XLSX: [Link to XLSX file](./datasets/xlsx/dataset.xlsx)

Feel free to choose the format that best suits your requirements.

## NLP Model

We have developed a state-of-the-art NLP model for classifying news articles. The model can predict the type and tags of a news article, making it a valuable tool for various applications.

## <a name='Requirements'></a>Requirements

### <a name='Python-Compatibility'></a>**Python Compatibility**
This bot is written entirely in python. tested versions are `python 3.11`, `3.10`, `3.9`, `3.8`, `3.7` while older versions should not cause any problem, we recommend using the latest version of `python3`.

### <a name='Dependencies'></a>**Dependencies**

This package requires the following packages:

* [AsyncIO](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html "AsyncIO HomePage") - asyncio is a library to write concurrent code using the async/await syntax.
* [AIOHTTP](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/ "AIOHTTP HomePage") - Asynchronous HTTP Client/Server for `asyncio` and Python.
* [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/ "SQLAlchemy Github") - SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.
* [BS4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/ "BeautifulSoup HomePage") - a Python library designed for quick turnaround projects like screen-scraping.
* [Psycopg](https://www.psycopg.org/ "SQLAlchemy Github") - Psycopg is the most popular `PostgreSQL` adapter for the Python programming language
* [aiosqlite](https://github.com/omnilib/aiosqlite "AIOSQLite Github") - asyncio bridge to the standard `sqlite3` module

### <a name='Scrap data'></a>Scrap data

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- `Python` (version `3.11.5`)
- `Git`

#### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohammadrezaAmani/JameJamCorpus
cd JameJamCorpus
```

#### Create and Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Install Requirements

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to Work

### Customize the Configuration

Edit the `jamejam/config.py` file to suit your needs. This file typically contains configuration parameters for your project.

```python
"""Configurations for the package"""

# ? Base url of the website
BASE_URL = "https://jamejamonline.ir/fa/news/"

# ? Start and end of dynamic id range
START = 1
END = 1433528

# ? Set the maximum number of concurrent calls per second
MAX_CALLS_PER_SECOND = 1024

# ? Database (postgresql offers better performance)
#! postgresql
# DATABASE_URL = "postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:password@localhost:5432/db_name"

#! sqlite
DATABASE_URL = "sqlite+aiosqlite:///data.db"

# ? Logging
DEBUG = True
DATABASE_LOGGING = False

```

#### Run the Project

Execute the following command to run the project:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start the application, and you should see the output in the console.
